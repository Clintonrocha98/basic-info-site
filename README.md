##A simple Node website!

Make a project directory and create the following files inside that directory:
- index.html
- about.html
- contact-me.html
- 404.html

###Create your node.js server file server.js and add the code needed to serve the right page according to the url.
- localhost:3333 should take users to index.html
- localhost:3333/about should take users to about.html
- localhost:3333/contact-me should take users to contact-me.html
- 404.html should display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above.
